The script takes the input of a file, calculates the hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), and then submits the *HASH* to Virus Total for analysis. The script will also run Strings against the sample.  The hashes, strings and Virus Total results are both displayed on screen and saved to a text report. Timestamp of the analysis is recorded in UTC. As of version 1.3 Mal-Hash.ps1 will operate (via PowerShell) on Windows, Mac & Linux.
